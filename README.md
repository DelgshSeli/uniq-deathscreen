## About This Resource

<a href="https://i.imgur.com/DsEorEI.png">Preview Resource</a>

* Clean and responsive UI
* Easy to configure & use
* ESX & QBCore compactibility
* Death Timer
* Killer (death reason)
* Emergency & accept to die buttons
* Choose between RP/Steam name

> The only thing that has to be set uped in this resource is framework and distress signal (Call Emergency button).
The reason why we did not set up distress signal is because many people are using third party resources that are not related to framework (ESX/QBCore) they are using.
However, we **WILL** help you setup distress signal for ESX and QBCore on our Discord Server.

### **DISCLAIMER**
> If any bugs or problems are found, please report the problem/pull request on GitHub page.
